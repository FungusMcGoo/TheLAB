Its Vintage Now!
[body]
I have a lot of projects in the works right now, from modding an Original xbox to brainstorming what to do with a stripped down laptop, so it wouldnt make sense for me to pause everything and dive head first into a new project but here I am. Finally, something excited enough to fill the contents of this first blog post; I have bought a 7th Generation iPod Classic from Facebook Marketplace for $100 AUD, the shell is covered in wear and tear and two buttons on the click wheel are completely broken, which may either be a simple clickwheel replacement or more serious damage to the logic board.
